# Exercise: Challenge B

You can find the Golang application "assistant" in this folder. The objective
is to create an Ubuntu ROCK called "challenge-b", that runs the `assistant` binary every time a container is deployed.

## Requirements

- [ ] The ROCK must be named "challenge-b"
- [ ] It must be built on Ubuntu 22.04, but have a `bare` base
- [ ] The ROCK's default user must be `_daemon_`
- [ ] The image must have an environment variable called `AUTHOR`, with your name
- [ ] The `assistant` binary must be built with Go>=1.21
- [ ] The ROCK must fetch the `README.md` file from <https://github.com/cjdcordeiro/pebble-to-rock-workshop.git>, rename it to `NOTES` and place it
and place inside the ROCK, at `/`
- [ ] The ROCK must also have a file `/build/date` with the build's timestamp
- [ ] When the container starts, it must run the `assistant` and then exit
the container (both "on-success" and "on-failure")

## Expected Outputs

The `assistant` program is executed with the image's entrypoint and can accept
arguments:

```bash
docker run challenge-b --args assistant -help
```

The `NOTE` (previously named `README.md`) file from the upstream GitHub
repository is under `/`:

```bash
docker run challenge-b ls /
```

```log

The ROCK's build date is written in a file, at `/build/date`:

```bash
docker run challenge-b --args assistant -time -read-file /build/date
```

```

---

The ROCK's default user is not `root`, but `_daemon_`:

```bash
docker inspect challenge-b -f '{{.Config.User}}'
```

```log
_daemon_
```

---

The `AUTHOR` environment variable is part of the ROCK:

```bash
docker inspect challenge-b -f '{{.Config.Env}}'
```

```log
[AUTHOR=Cristovao Cordeiro]
```

---

Finally, for fun, the image has no `ubuntu:22.04` base:

```bash
dive challenge-b:latest
```
